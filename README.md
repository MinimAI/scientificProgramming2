# Making multivariate statistics reproducible
The R Markdown notebook `main.Rmd` uses a partial least squares model for the ability to activate BRCA1 expression (PubChem Assay AID 624202). The notebook uses a `.csv`, from which the activity scores are taken, and a `.sdf` file, which is used to compute the descriptor matrix, from [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/624202). The code chunks to compute the descriptor matrix are deactivated, as they are rather time-consuming, and the pre-computed matrix in the `descriptors12200.csv` is used for further computations. The notebook uses a training-test set split of 80/20. Additionally, the model is tuned using cross-validation to estimate the number of latent variables to use in the model. Finally, various plots are produced to show the accuracy of the model, which is unfortunately not very high, as the model was not able to accurately predict the activity scores.

A compiled notebook is hosted [here](https://minimai.github.io/scientificProgramming2/main.html). The files necessary to reproduce the compiled notebook can be found at [github](https://github.com/MinimAI/scientificProgramming2), as well as [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/624202). The notebook automatically takes care of installing and loading all required packages. Thus, you only need to change the working directory to let the notebook import the necessary files.
